# Credit Card Fraud Detection with SciKit-Learn

This repository contains code that does the following:

- Performs data preparation and visualization to understand the proposed solution.
- Trains an unsupervised learning model (DBSCAN) on a subset of the anonymized credit card purchase metrics in the set.
- Plays back the purchase data in real-time and applies the trained model to predict credit card fraud in real-time.
